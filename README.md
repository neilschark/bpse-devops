## Developing and Operation of a (Web)-Application with DevOps Engineering Principles

In this project you will be creating a web application with DevOps principles.
This means you (and your team) will plan, develop, deploy, operate and monitor the application in the hda cloud. To accomplish this you will use GitLab-CI and create pipelines to automate all relevant tasks.
All server infrastructure is provided.

This project aims to simulate a real development team where you will get consecutive requirements and independently have to implement them.

Each team can choose their software stack freely, as long as it can accomplish the requirements.
Programming knowledge is needed!

The key aspects you will learn and use are:

- Project management
- Application development
- Developer experience
- CI/CD and pipelines
- Monitoring and operations

This project will have small presentations for key aspects of DevOps made by the lecturers to give you some ideas on how to proceed, but the contents are not the only accepted solution. You are encouraged to solve the problem in your own way, as long as you can justify it.
